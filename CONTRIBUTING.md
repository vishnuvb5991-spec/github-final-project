## 🛠 How to Contribute

Inspired by [Legit Info](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Legit-Info), [OpenEEW](https://github.com/openeew/openeew/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html), here’s a simple workflow:

1. **Fork** the repository  
2. **Create a branch** for your contribution (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)  
3. **Make your changes** (code, docs, tests, or ideas)  
4. **Run tests** (if applicable) to ensure everything works  
5. **Commit** with a clear message (`git commit -m "Add feature: my-feature"`)  
6. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request**
